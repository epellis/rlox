# Rlox

Rlox is an implementation of the [Lox Language](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) in Rust. For those unfamiliar with Lox, it is a dynamically typed, interpreted language similar to Lua and Javascript with syntax similar to any language in the C family.

## Run
```
cargo test
cargo run demo.lox
